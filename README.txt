🐾 Stray Dog
Stray Dog is a fun and challenging 2D arcade-style game built using Python and Pygame. In this game, you play as a boy trying to dodge a stray dog while collecting coins scattered throughout the map. As you collect more coins, the game becomes faster and harder — testing your reflexes and strategy!

🎮 Gameplay
You control a boy character using the keyboard arrow keys.

A stray dog actively chases you around the map.

Your goal is to collect as many coins as possible while avoiding the dog.

With every few coins collected, the level increases — and so does the game speed and difficulty.

If the dog touches you — Game Over!
